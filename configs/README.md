# Configuration Files

This directory contains configuration files for deployment and infrastructure.

## Purpose

The `configs/` directory is used to store configuration files that are specific to different deployment environments or infrastructure components. These files should not contain sensitive information like passwords or API keys (use environment variables for those).

## Examples of Configuration Files

- Nginx site configurations
- Load balancer configurations
- CDN configurations
- Cache configurations
- Database configurations
- Monitoring configurations

## Usage

Configuration files in this directory should be referenced by deployment scripts or documentation. They can be copied to the appropriate location during deployment or used as templates for generating the actual configuration files.

## Best Practices

1. Keep configuration files modular and focused on a single concern
2. Use templates with placeholders for values that change between environments
3. Document the purpose and usage of each configuration file
4. Version control all configuration files
5. Avoid hardcoding sensitive information
